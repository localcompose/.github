# ðŸš§ localcompose

**localcompose** is a community-driven toolset for managing local Docker Compose stacks in an offline-first, no-cloud-required way.

ðŸ”§ Current focus:  
We are actively developing `locom`, a command-line tool to orchestrate local-only Docker Compose workflows with simplicity and clarity.

ðŸ’¡ Vision:  
Support developers, testers, and tinkerers who prefer local, private, and reliable environments â€” without unnecessary cloud complexity.
