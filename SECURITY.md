# Security Policy for LocalCompose

## Reporting a Vulnerability

LocalCompose uses GitHub Security Advisories for confidential security reporting. 
To report a security vulnerability:

1. Navigate to our Security Advisories page: [Submit Security Advisory](https://github.com/localcompose/security-reports/security/advisories)
2. Only the security team can see and triage your submission.
3. Please do **not** report vulnerabilities in public issues, pull requests, or discussions.
4. *Tip for community reporters:* Keep the link provided after submission to review or update your report. If you lose the link or cannot access your original submission, submitting a new advisory with updated information is welcome. The security team values updates from community reporters to help triage and resolve vulnerabilities.

## How and When to Report

- Only submit issues that represent genuine security vulnerabilities.
- Provide as much detail as possible to reproduce the issue safely.
- The security team will review, triage, and coordinate fixes privately.
- Once resolved, advisories may be disclosed publicly with fixes.
